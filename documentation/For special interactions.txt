When you wish to interact with an object, it will check the object you are moving into
the same way it checks if there is an obstruction, except it will be a different ArrayList<Character>
and if the arraylist contains the character the player is moving into, it will handle an event
based on what the character is.

//This will go above the check for moving that Entity AND Player has. For every direction
if(MapManipulator.*interact*.contains(MapManipulator.map.get(mapCoords.y-1).get(mapCoords.x))
{
	//Handle in some way, this is just an example
	
	//I am not 100% switch works with characters, i think it does though.
	switch(MapManipulator.map.get(mapCoords.y-1.get(mapCoords.x))
	{
		case '@':
			//call method
			break;
		case '*':
			//call method
			break;
	}
}

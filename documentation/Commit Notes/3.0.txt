This commit mainly includes moving towards having a more optimized way to draw to screen.
This works with resizing 48x48 tilesize maps to 96x96. Which
appears to run faster.

Additionally, it includes remake of map4 and related sprites, which is the first space map.


For next commit, we want to add a global variable for the magnification coefficient to be used in draw()
to eliminate the if(MapManipulator.mapBitmapNum == [num]) and just retrieve it instead.
